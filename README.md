# Real Estate Price Prediction
This project is a step by step process of a real estate price prediction model. I build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. During model building I covered almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers.

- Python
- Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Sklearn for model building
- Jupyter notebook
