# House-Price-Prediction
This project is a step by step process of how to build a real estate price prediction model. I build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. During model building I covered almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,

-1. Python
-2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
-3. Matplotlib for data visualization
-4.Sklearn for model building
-5.Jupyter notebook
